Wonder what I'll do
when the cops come through
And the whiskey's run out
'Cause I've been lookin' at you
since half past two
Wanna take this downtown?
This liquid courage got me way
too honest
Put your phone on vibrate,
let's catch a vibe, babe
While the sun's down
Hush now, I know we're a little
too fucked up to stay still,
love
Be as quiet as you can,
'cause if anyone sees
They'll just blow shit up
I don't gotta know
if you're taken
I'll just let ya know
bedroom's vacant
No one's gotta know,
just us and the moon
'til the sun starts wakin'
Up's the only direction I see
As long as we keep this
Low, low, low, low, low,
low, low, low-key
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo-
lo- lo- lo- lo-love me
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Us in a king-size,
keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen,
I don't wanna leave this
Low, low, low, low,
low, low, low, low-key
Wizard with words tellin' me
my energy's so bewitchin'
So I'll go first,
there's an open bar,
let's close this distance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my,
don't make me have to
spell it all night
I don't really
give a fuck 'bout all
the 'he said, she said' bullshit
So pick your poison, love,
let's go somewhere a little
more exclusive
Take a shot, take a chance,
take my hand, boy
Tension so intense
like an asteroid
Be discreet,
gotta dodge all the tabloids
Let's not think too much,
there ain't no problems
So long as we keep this
Low, low, low, low, low,
low, low, low-key
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo-
lo- lo- lo- lo-love me
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Us in a king-size,
keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen,
I don't wanna leave this
Low, low, low, low,
low, low, low, low-key
Low-key, low-key
Low-key, low-key
